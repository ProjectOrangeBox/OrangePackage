Orange Framework Runtime Core

src/Application.php:1 Bootstraps env/config, seeds the DI container, and drives HTTP or CLI lifecycles while firing framework events.
src/Container.php:1 Singleton DI container that registers values/closures/classes, autowires dependencies, resolves aliases, and promotes singleton services.
src/Router.php:1 Maintains the route table, matches URI + verb to callbacks with parameter validation/caching, and generates URLs for named routes.
src/Dispatcher.php:1 Bridges matched routes to controller methods via the container, decodes parameters, and enforces string responses.
src/Input.php:1 Normalizes request data from superglobals/raw stream, supports method overrides, and exposes helpers for headers, segments, schemes, and request type.
src/Output.php:1 Buffers body/headers/status, handles redirects or HTTPS enforcement, and flushes the final response (or exits) in a testable way.
Support Services

src/Config.php:1 Scans configured directories, merges environment-specific files (with optional caching), and offers array/object access to configuration.
src/Event.php:1 Priority-based event bus for registering and triggering lifecycle hooks, with global enable/disable control.
src/Error.php:1 Central error responder that populates data, picks environment/request-specific views or raw fallbacks, and pushes the response through Output.
src/View.php:1 & src/abstract/ViewAbstract.php:1 Provide the view-engine foundation—directory search, aliasing, dynamic view resolution, and rendered/cached templates.
src/Data.php:1 Singleton ArrayObject shared store so services/controllers can share state via property-style access.
src/interfaces Declares contracts for core services (container, router, input, output, etc.) to keep implementations swappable and test-friendly.
Ops & Infrastructure

src/Security.php:1 Libsodium-backed toolkit for key generation, encryption/decryption, HMAC signatures, password hashing, and input sanitization behind SecurityInterface.
src/Log.php:1 PSR-3 compliant logger honoring configurable thresholds, delegating to injected handlers or its own file writer with safety checks.
src/controllers/BaseController.php:1 Shared controller base that wires config/input/output, autoloads declared services/libraries/helpers, and extends view search paths.
src/controllers/HomeController.php:1 Default landing controller returning the starter HTML page; swap it to customize the “/” route quickly.
src/helpers/helpers.php:1 Grab bag of global utilities (atomic file writes, HTML builders, string/encoding helpers, escaping, etc.) used across the framework.
src/config & src/exceptions Ship default service/route/view/security settings plus framework-specific exception types (HTTP, router, container, filesystem, etc.) consumed by the core classes.
